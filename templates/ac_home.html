        <p>
            This website includes two tools for the video game Teamfight Tactics.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Calculator tool allows you to precisely calculate your chance to hit at least a single copy of a
            champion when rollling down. The data in the following figure has been calculated with that tool. Let's look
            at it, to understand how this can be useful.
        </p>

        <div class="mt-2 mb-2 text-center">
            <img src="/static/plot4.png" width="75%" style="border-radius: 1%;" alt="">
        </div>

        <p>
            Here we can see the chance to hit an Epic Tier unit, when rolling down on the levels 5, 6, and 7. The data
            is from an old patch, but the general idea is still the same. On the y-axis there is the chance to hit the
            unit, and on the x-axis is the amount of gold we invested. Our graphs start at different points, why is
            that? Well leveling from 5 to 6 and from 6 to 7 costs a certain amount of gold. So what does this figure
            tell us? When we have 40 gold available, leveling to 6 and rolling is just as good as staying on 5 and
            rolling. If we have more gold than that, we can see, that rolling on 6 quickly outperforms rolling on 5. At
            80 gold invested we have a chance bigger than 80% to hit our unit on 6, while staying on 5 would leave us at
            less than 70%. Leveling to 7 is very costy. If we really only care about hitting that one Epic Tier unit, we
            should only level to 7 if we have more than 110 gold available.
        </p>

        <p>
            But once again, this data is from an old patch! Don't use this figure for reference for the current one. Use
            the calculator to check the up to date numbers.
        </p>

        <p>
            The second tool is a simulator. With that, we can create more complex scenarios. The resulting chances are
            created with Monte-Carlo-Simulation. For both tools, there are explanations on the internals available.
        </p>
